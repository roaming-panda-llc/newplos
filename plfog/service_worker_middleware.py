    Add Service-Worker-Allowed header for service worker requests.

    This middleware is NOT redundant with the vapid_key view - they serve different purposes:
    - vapid_key view: serves the VAPID public key to clients for push subscription
    - This middleware: adds header to allow service worker to control root scope
